Serialization
============================
1. Serialization is the process of preserving the state of the class so that we can transmit over the network either to persist or write to a file.

2. For Serialization we user writeObject of ObjectOutputStream and deserialization we use readObject of ObjectInputStream class

3. We need to implement Serializable interface to acheive Serialization. This is a marker interface

4. String class by default implement Serializable interface

5. If a class implements Serializable then all its subclasses will also be Serializable  (IS-A)

		class A implements Serializable {
		
		}
		
		class B extends A { // This class will also be Serialized
		
		}

6. If a class has a reference which implements Serializable interface, then all the classes should implement Serializable (HAS-A)

		class Address {
		
		}
		
		class Employee implements Serializable{	
		
			private Address a;// This class should implement Serializable. Otherwise NotSerializableException will be thrown
		}

7. If there are any static fields in the class then they are not Serialized as they are not part of state of the class

8. In case of collections, all the objects must be Serialized

9. If we do not want any field to be serialized, we need to use 'transient' key word

10. All the primitive datatypes and objects will be serialized.
