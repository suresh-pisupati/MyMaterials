@Qualifier is used at @Component level. We cannot use this annotation at @Configuration.
When there are multiple beans of same type to avoid the ambiguity for creating the object, @Qualifier is used.

For ex:

public interface Bike {
  public void model();
}

@Qualifier("heroBike")
public class HeroBike implements Bike {
  public void model() {
    ....
  }
}  

@Qualifier("hondaBike")
public class HondaBike implements Bike {
  public void model() {
    ....
  }
}  

@Component
public class BikeTest {

  @Autowired
  private Bike bike; //Here spring container will throw error. Because there is ambiguity for creating the type of object. To avoid this @Qualifier is used
  
  @Autowired
  @Qualifier( "heroBike" )
  private Bike bike;
}

@Primary is used to remove the ambigutiy for creating the same objects at the configuration level

@Cofiguration
public class BikeTest {

  @Bean
  @Primary
  private Bike getBike() {
    return new HondaBike();
  }
  
  @Bean
  private Bike getBike() {
    return new HeroBike();
  }
}
