Concurrency Using Executor Services and Executors.

Executor and ExecutorService:
--------------------------------------
Executor Service are higher level replacement for Threads. Executors are capable of running tasks 
in parallel.

There are two methods which can be used for executing the tasks in parallel using Executors:
	i. execute()	-> which performs the task asynchronously but has 'void' return type.
						-> will take only runnable interface as a parameter
	ii. submit()	-> which performs the task asynchronously but has return type 'Future' object
						-> accepts runnable and callable interfaces as parameters


Executors have to be stopped explicitly. Which can be done by using two methods
	i. shutdown() -> which will wait for the current running task to be completed
	ii. shutdownnow() -> interrupts all the running tasks and shut downs the executor immediately.
	
Callable interfaces are also functional interface similar to Runnable interface but
	i. Callable interface will return Object
	ii. throws exception if unable to compute the result.  
	

ScheduledExecutorService
---------------------------------
In order to run periodically run common tasks multiple times we user ScheduledExecutorService.

The tasks can be run in parallel or all at a time.
